# Decentralized Commercial Parking Management

A blockchain-based solution for transparent, efficient, and automated commercial parking operations.

## Overview

The Decentralized Commercial Parking Management platform leverages blockchain technology to revolutionize how commercial parking facilities are managed, booked, and monetized. By distributing critical operations across smart contracts, this system provides unprecedented transparency, automation, and security for parking facility operators and their customers while optimizing space utilization and streamlining payment processes.

## Core Smart Contracts

### Facility Registration Contract

- Maintains immutable facility specifications and features
- Stores location data, operating hours, and access methods
- Manages owner/operator credentials and permissions
- Enables facility onboarding with verification mechanisms

### Space Inventory Contract
- Tracks available parking capacity in real-time
- Categorizes spaces by type (standard, compact, accessible, EV charging)
- Monitors occupancy rates and usage patterns
- Enables dynamic inventory adjustment for maintenance or special events
- Provides historical utilization data for optimization

### Reservation Contract
- Manages advance bookings and recurring permits
- Processes spot reservations, day passes, and long-term parking arrangements
- Supports scheduling for different time increments (hourly, daily, monthly)
- Handles reservation modifications and cancellations with defined policies
- Implements priority allocation rules for different user tiers

### Payment Processing Contract
- Handles fees for parking usage through cryptocurrency or token payments
- Automates billing based on actual usage time
- Manages subscription-based payment models
- Processes refunds according to cancellation policies
- Maintains transparent transaction history and receipts
